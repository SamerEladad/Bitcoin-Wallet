# Bitcoin-Wallet

## Overview
This project, developed as part of the IT Security lecture at Hochschule Bochum, focuses on creating a Bitcoin Wallet with an emphasis on information security. The wallet allows for the creation, management, and execution of secure Bitcoin transactions.

## Features
- **User Interface**: An intuitive interface displaying wallet balance, transaction history, and network status.
- **Transactions**: Support for creating and signing transactions, including Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) transactions.
- **Testnet and Mainnet Support**: Compatibility with both Bitcoin Testnet and Mainnet, allowing for safe testing and real transactions.

## Security Aspects
- **Private Key Management**: Emphasis on secure generation and storage of private keys.
- **Encryption**: Utilization of robust encryption algorithms for data protection.
- **Malware and Phishing Protection**: Measures to safeguard against common cyber threats.
- **Network Security**: Ensuring secure communication within the Bitcoin network.
- **Risks and Mitigation**: Comprehensive risk analysis with implemented strategies to minimize potential vulnerabilities.

## Technology Stack
- **Key Generation**: Using RSA 265 Algorithm and Bouncy Castle Provider for secure key generation.
- **Encryption Algorithms**: Incorporating EC (Elliptic Curve) algorithm, PBKDF2 for password-based key derivation, and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for data encryption.

## Blockchain Security
- **Decentralization**: Leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain for enhanced security.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Utilizing Proof of Work (PoW) to validate transactions and secure the network.
- **Anonymity and Privacy**: Ensuring user privacy through cryptographic techniques and pseudonymity.

## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Key Security**: Plans to increase the entropy of salt values in key generation.
- **Segregated Witness (SegWit)**: Implementing SegWit to counter transaction malleability.
- **HTTPS Protocol**: Shifting to HTTPS for secure API communication.

## Conclusion
The project aims to achieve a high level of IT security by adhering to BSI IT-Grundschutz guidelines and continuously addressing and mitigating security risks.
